# General Steps To Training Models
This is a high level guide to making a AI model.
1.)Choose a problem. For examplse, differentiate between cats and dogs.
2.)Get training data sets and allocate them to a proper folder organization. 
3.)Teach model using compute such as GPUs or TPUs.
4.)Verify if model is correct.
5.)Extract model and expose to an API.


# Advice on training and launching prototypes.
For small time training, use Kaggle or local Juypter notebooks and connect them to GPUs for training.Locally, one can use gradio to launch the API quickly to test. 


# Terminologies
Epoch - Cycles to train a model
Train loss - 
Epoch loss - 
Valid loss -
Error rate - 
Fine tune - 
Pickel model - 

# Helpful tools
1.) Viola - turn juypter notebook into a real app
